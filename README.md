This code compares the quality of data generated by GPT-4, an LLM, to teh quality of data provided by human samples of various sizes.

## Data

All data can be found in `data`.

- `data/official/human`: contains the original human "ground truth" ratings for each dataset tested.  
- `data/official/llm`: contains the original LLM ratings for each dataset tested.  
- `data/processed/llm`: contains the aggregated human results from each new experiment, as well as the results of the primary analyses.

## Analyses

The `src/analysis` folder contains code for running the primary analyses.

- The Jupyter notebooks contain Python code to execute the primary analyses for each dataset.  
- The `Visualization.Rmd` R file contains code to reproduce the primary visualizations for the manuscript.
